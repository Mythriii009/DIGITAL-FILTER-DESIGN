IN THIS TASK, I HAVE DESIGNED A BASIC DIGITAL FIR FILTER USING VERILOG HDL (HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE). FIR STANDS FOR FINITE IMPULSE RESPONSE, WHICH IS A TYPE OF DIGITAL FILTER USED TO PROCESS SIGNALS IN DIGITAL SYSTEMS. THIS FILTER IS VERY USEFUL IN REMOVING NOISE, SMOOTHING SIGNALS, AND MODIFYING THE FREQUENCY CONTENT OF SIGNALS IN MANY ELECTRONIC DEVICES.

IN THIS DESIGN, I HAVE IMPLEMENTED A SIMPLE 4-TAP FIR FILTER. "TAP" MEANS THE NUMBER OF COEFFICIENTS OR DELAY ELEMENTS USED IN THE FILTER. MORE TAPS USUALLY MEAN BETTER FILTERING BUT INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY. THE EQUATION USED FOR THE FIR FILTER IS:

Y[N] = H0 * X[N] + H1 * X[N-1] + H2 * X[N-2] + H3 * X[N-3]

HERE, X[N] IS THE CURRENT INPUT SAMPLE, AND H0, H1, H2, H3 ARE THE COEFFICIENTS OF THE FILTER. IN THIS CODE, THE COEFFICIENTS ARE CHOSEN AS 1, 2, 3, AND 4 FOR SIMPLICITY. THESE ARE JUST SAMPLE VALUES, AND IN REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS, THE COEFFICIENTS ARE DESIGNED BASED ON THE REQUIRED FILTER CHARACTERISTICS.

THE FIR FILTER DESIGN INCLUDES A REGISTER BANK THAT STORES THE PAST INPUT VALUES AND MULTIPLIES THEM WITH THE FIXED COEFFICIENTS. THEN IT ADDS THEM TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUT.

FOR SIMULATION, I CREATED A TESTBENCH MODULE IN VERILOG WHERE I SUPPLIED SOME SAMPLE INPUT VALUES TO THE FILTER AT EACH CLOCK CYCLE. THE OUTPUT OF THE FILTER WAS MONITORED USING THE $MONITOR STATEMENT WHICH PRINTS TIME, INPUT, AND OUTPUT VALUES ON THE CONSOLE. THIS HELPS US TO VERIFY THAT THE FILTER IS WORKING CORRECTLY.

THE TOOLS USED FOR THIS TASK ARE:

VERILOG HDL – USED TO WRITE THE DIGITAL DESIGN CODE FOR THE FIR FILTER.

SIMULATION TOOL (LIKE MODEL SIM OR VIVADO) – USED TO SIMULATE THE VERILOG CODE AND OBSERVE THE OUTPUT.

GTKWave – OPTIONAL TOOL USED TO VIEW THE WAVEFORM OF THE OUTPUT FOR BETTER VISUAL UNDERSTANDING.

TEXT EDITOR (VISUAL STUDIO CODE / VSCODE) – USED TO WRITE AND ORGANIZE THE VERILOG CODE. IT PROVIDES SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING, INDENTATION, AND EASY NAVIGATION.

THIS PROJECT CAN BE APPLIED IN MANY DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING (DSP) APPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT CAN BE USED IN AUDIO PROCESSING TO REMOVE NOISE FROM SOUND, IN IMAGE PROCESSING TO REMOVE BLUR FROM PHOTOS, IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS TO FILTER OUT UNWANTED SIGNALS, AND IN SENSORS TO SMOOTH OUT SIGNALS FROM HARDWARE. FIR FILTERS ARE USED IN MOBILE PHONES, TELEVISIONS, RADIOS, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, AND EVEN IN SATELLITES.

THIS TASK IS VERY USEFUL FOR BEGINNER STUDENTS WHO WANT TO LEARN HOW DIGITAL FILTERS WORK AND HOW TO DESIGN THEM USING VERILOG. THIS IS ALSO A GOOD EXERCISE TO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF DIGITAL SYSTEM DESIGN, CLOCKING, REGISTER SHIFTING, AND MULTIPLY-ACCUMULATE OPERATIONS WHICH ARE VERY COMMON IN HARDWARE DESIGN
